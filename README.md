Introduction:-

Bruteforce attacks create a significant risk to the security of online systems, from web applications and SSH servers to database access. These attacks usually involve automated tools that attempt a large number of login attempts in a short period. This project aims to develop a strong detection tool that can identify and alert administrators to ongoing bruteforce attempts, enabling timely actions.

Project Goals:-

Develop a monitoring system: A system that can effectively monitor authentication attempts on a target service (e.g., SSH, web login, RDP).

Implement detection logic: This algorithms to identify patterns indicative of bruteforce attacks (eg- failed login attempts from a single IP, multiple failed attempts across different usernames).

Provide alerting mechanisms: This methods to notify administrators of detected attacks (eg- email, SMS, logging).

Temporary IP Banning: Automatically bans IP addresses that exceed the attempt threshold, preventing further access for a specified period.

Offer basic Corrective actions: Provide guidance on potential actions to take upon attack detection.
